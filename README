Cubicle is a tool that combines model checking algorithms and automatic SMT
theorem provers with a powerful invariants inference mechanism.

Various examples can be found in the subdirectory examples/.

COPYRIGHT
=========

This program is distributed under the Apache Software License version 2.0. See
the enclosed file COPYING.


INSTALLATION
============

To compile Cubicle you will need OCaml version 3.12 (or newer) and issue:

    ./configure
    make

then with superuser rights:

    make install

Cubicle comes with its own emacs major mode in doc/emacs/cubicle-mode.el. You
should copy this file to your emacs.d directory (or anywhere in your load path)
and add the following to your init file (.emacs or emacs.d/init.el):

    (setq auto-mode-alist
          (cons '("\\.cub$" . cubicle-mode) auto-mode-alist))
    (autoload 'cubicle-mode "cubicle-mode" "Major mode for Cubicle." t)

To add colors to the compilation buffer, also add this:

     (require 'ansi-color)
     (defun colorize-compilation-buffer ()
       (toggle-read-only)
       (ansi-color-apply-on-region (point-min) (point-max))
       (toggle-read-only))
     (add-hook 'compilation-filter-hook 'colorize-compilation-buffer)


USAGE
=====

To run Cubicle with its classical backward reachability algorithm on a file
file.cub simply do:
 
    cubicle file.cub

To run Cubicle with the BRAB algorithm (with a preliminary forward exploration
using 2 processes) on a file file.cub simply do:
 
    cubicle -brab 2 file.cub

You can see the list of Cubcile's options by doing:

    cubicle -h
