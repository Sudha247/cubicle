- Disjunctions of unsafe formulas
- Extend the syntax for expressions (universal guards, arithmetic formulas etc.)
- Compute the tau function only once
- Split expansion and implication checks
- Call SMT solvers with the all disjunction
- Exploit the incrementality and persistency of Alt-Ergo
- Perform arithmetic simplification (see swimming_pool example)
- Improve the generation invariant mechanism
- Mix backward and forward reasoning
