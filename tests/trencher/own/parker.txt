# A model of the example revealing bug in the Parker class:
#
# D. Dice. A race in locksupport park() arising from weak memory models.
# https://blogs.oracle.com/dave/entry/a_race_in_locksupport_park, Nov 2009.
#
# Thread parker executes: while (cond == 0) park();
# Thread unparker executes: cond = 1; unpark(T1);
#
# IS NOT robust.
#
# Memory layout:
# 0 — cond
# 1 — park_counter
