  Objective Caml. The main features of this library
  include (1) a polymorphic API, (2) several implementations to
  adapt to different deployment scenarios such as sequential,
  multi-core or network, and (3) a reliable fault-tolerance mechanism.
  This paper describes the motivation behind this work, as well as
  the design and implementation of the library. It also demonstrates
  the potential of the library using realistic experiments.}
